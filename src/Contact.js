                            <p>After a mixed first half of the year, it finally seems as though things are looking up for Xbox Game Pass. After a few months of lackluster additions, Xbox Game Pass is starting to ramp up its output a bit more, with a good few day-one titles heading to the service in July. While the heavy hitter this month is Capcom's new dinosaur co-op exosuit shooter Exoprimal, Xbox Game Pass has also just confirmed that Maquette, originally a PlayStation Plus-exclusive, is heading to the service later this month.</p>
